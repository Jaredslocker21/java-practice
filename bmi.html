    <h1>What is BMI?</h1>

    <p>
        "Body mass index (BMI) is a person’s weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters. BMI is an
        inexpensive and easy screening method for weight category—underweight, healthy weight, overweight, and obesity.
        <br>
        <br>
        BMI does not measure body fat directly, but BMI is moderately correlated with more direct measures of body fat
        1,2,3. Furthermore, BMI appears to be as strongly correlated with various metabolic and disease outcome as are
        these more direct measures of body fatness 4,5,6,7,8,9."
