    <h1> What is BMR? </h1>

    <p>
        
        Basal metabolic rate (BMR) estimates the minimum number of calories a person needs to burn to sustain their
        basic life functions during a 24-hour period of rest. Examples of such functions include:
        breathing, circulation, digestion and absorption of nutrients cellular processes. BMR takes into account a
        persons activity level, height, weight, age and sex.
    <br>
        "BMR represents about 45–70% of daily energy expenditure, depending on age, gender, body size and
        composition. Physical activity is the most variable determinant of energy need and is the second largest user of
        energy after BMR. Humans perform a number of physical activities including the obligatory demands of an
        individual’s economic, social and cultural environment (eg occupational, schoolwork, housework etc) or
        discretionary activity (eg energy expended for optional exercise or sport, or in additional social or cultural
        interactions)."  https://www.nrv.gov.au/dietary-energy
      
        <br>
        Your basal metabolism rate is produced through the following basal metablic rate formula:

        Men;BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 x weight in kg) + (4.799 x height in cm) (5.677 x age in years)
        Women: BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 x weight in kg) + (3.098 x height in cm) (4.330 x age in years)
