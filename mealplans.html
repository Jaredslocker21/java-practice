    <h1>Why Create a Meal Plan?</h1>

    <p> 
        Meal Planning can be a vital tool to healthy eating and a huge part of creating a balance in what we eat.
        Understanding our body type(BMI calculator). How much activity we spend, our age, sex, weight and height.(BMR calculator)
        <br>
        <br>  
        We can put together a plan for maintaining better health through our daily caloric consumption.  
        <br>
        Basically we can adjust our coloric intake when we are less active and maintain fat(sedentary) growth. i.e working from home.
        <br>
        <br>
         I did not say diet.. But.   "A calorie deficit of 500 calories per day is effective for healthy and sustainable weight loss."" https://www.healthline.com/nutrition/
        <br>
        <br>
         Creating a balance in your eating lifestyle does not mean dieting by any means.
         It means allowing you to organize your meals as a guide to  balance your
         five food groups: Fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, dairy or fortified soy products every day.
         <br>
         <br> 
          It will make us aware of added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.
