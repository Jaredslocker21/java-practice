    <h1>Why Create a Meal Plan?</h1>

    <p> 
        Meal Planning can be a vital tool to healthy eating and a huge part of creating a balance in what we eat.
        <br>
        <br>

        <br>
        <br>
         Creating a balance in your eating lifestyle does not mean dieting by any means.
         It means allowing you to organize your meals as a guide to  balance your
         five food groups: Fruits, vegetables, grains, protein foods, dairy or fortified soy products every day.
         <br>
         <br> 
          It will make us aware of added sugars, saturated fat, and sodium.
